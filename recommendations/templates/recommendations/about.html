    <h3>Content-Based Filtering</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      Content-Based Filtering recommends movies based on the attributes of the
      movie itself. This method relies on analyzing the content of movies to
      find similarities. Key features such as genre, actors, directors, and
      specific keywords (like “thrilling” or “romantic”) are used to recommend
      movies that share similar characteristics with ones you have enjoyed
      previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> If you enjoyed the movie "Inception," which is a
      sci-fi thriller directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Leonardo DiCaprio,
      a content-based recommender might suggest other sci-fi thrillers or movies
      directed by Christopher Nolan.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sports Analogy:</strong> Imagine you’re a fan of basketball and
      you love watching players who are known for their exceptional defensive
      skills and agility, like Kawhi Leonard. A content-based system might
      suggest watching other players or games that highlight strong defensive
      strategies or similar player profiles.

    <h3>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a collaborative filtering algorithm that
      recommends movies based on the preferences of users who have similar taste
      profiles to you. This method does not require explicit attributes of the
      movies but instead looks at the behavior of users. It finds users with
      similar rating patterns and recommends movies that those users have rated
      highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> If you and another user both rated several
      action movies highly, and that user also loved the movie "Mad Max: Fury
      Road," the KNN algorithm might suggest "Mad Max: Fury Road" to you, even
      if you haven’t watched it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sports Analogy:</strong> Think of a soccer team’s scouting
      department looking for new players. They might look at players who have
      performed well in teams with similar play styles and formations. If your
      favorite team excels with fast-paced, high-pressing tactics, scouts might
      recommend players from other teams that use similar tactics and have
      players with strong performances in those areas.

    <h3>Hybrid Approaches</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p>
      Hybrid recommendation systems combine both content-based and collaborative
      filtering techniques to provide more accurate and diverse suggestions. By
      leveraging the strengths of both methods, hybrid systems can recommend
      movies that are similar to those you like and also introduce you to new
      genres or types based on the preferences of similar users.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example:</strong> A hybrid system might suggest a mix of sci-fi
      thrillers like "Interstellar" (based on your liking for "Inception") and
      highly rated action movies from other users with similar tastes, like "Mad
      Max: Fury Road."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Sports Analogy:</strong> In sports, hybrid scouting approaches are
      common. For example, a basketball team might combine player statistics
      (content-based) with scouting reports and performance reviews from other
      teams or leagues (collaborative filtering) to find the best new recruits
      who fit both the team’s style and have a proven track record.
